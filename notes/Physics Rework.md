- [x] Narrow phase detection
- [x] Debug renderer
- [x] Physical response
- [ ] ~~Broad phase aabb tree~~
	- just keep the dumb O(nÂ²) version for live entities, return to broad phase strategies only when needed (at that point should have a better idea of the project's needs)
- [x] Finish implementing shape types (support functions)
- [x] Amalgamate update data batch
- [x] Tileset shapes
- [x] Broad phase tilemap sample
- [x] physical collision filtering
- [x] decouple query & solve from simstep
	- [x] query
	- [x] solve
	- [x] application ?
	- might be more to decouple, anything that can just take the buffers as input instead
- [x] Layer flags collision matrix ?
	- [x] detection
	- [x] physical
- [x] fixed timestep
- [x] Fix energy conservation
- [ ] tilemap surface properties
- [ ] Actor fields ?
- [x] decouple & make a version of shape dedicated to narrow
	- shape is always convex for narrow
	- simpler shape, only goal is to make a support function
	- no need for tree in the shape, offsets will be done with a single transform at submit point
- may be able to just fix the jitter
- narrow & broad phase are too coupled
