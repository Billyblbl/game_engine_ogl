- [x] Narrow phase detection
- [x] Debug renderer
- [x] Physical response
- [ ] Broad phase aabb tree
	- [ ] make broad phase data structs based on narrow's input
- [ ] Broad phase tilemap sample
- [x] decouple & make a version of shape dedicated to narrow
	- shape is always convex for narrow
	- simpler shape, only goal is to make a support function
	- no need for tree in the shape, offsets will be done with a single transform at submit point
- may be able to just fix the jitter
- narrow & broad phase are too coupled
